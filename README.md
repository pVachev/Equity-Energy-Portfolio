# Equity-Energy-Portfolio

This is a Portfolio project on a basket of shares of energy and commodity companies in Europe. Weigting not yet determined. 

The main point of the portfoio is to try and predict the share prices of energy companies' stocks using the energy and commodity market prices. Portfolio will include long and short positions of the following stocks*: 

1. Shell
2. TotalEnergies
3. Equinor
4. BP
5. OMV

It is possible that we add commodity future positions to a separate hedging portfolio. We currently conduct a correlation study on the percentage returns of energy and commodities with the shares of the companies. Based on this we will build to determine the weights on portfolio along with the help of classic portfolio models. 

*Basket of equities is subject to change. 

Current filing of the project is Jupyter Notebook and the project will be done in Python.
